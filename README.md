# Packix DRM Middleman

Middleman is an in-between server for Packix's DRM API.

Use this in order to keep your Developer Access Key a secret. Preferably, use HTTPS if you are going to use it on your own server.

If you are a tweak developer and would like to use this without hosting it yourself, please feel free to contact me on twitter: @fr0st or via email at gmorandotme@gmail.com
